**OVERVIEW**

This project simulates the data infrastructure of a modern music streaming platform. With platforms like Spotify serving nearly 700 million monthly users and generating hundreds of gigabytes of data daily, managing and processing real-time data is critical for operations and trend analysis. This project focuses on building and managing an ETL data pipeline that mimics the systems used in large-scale streaming platforms.

One of my goals with this project was to continue to build upon my fundamentals that I have been learning in my AWS Certifcation Courses, as well as in my previous Smart City Project. With implementation of the Medallion Architecture as well as basic automation, I can say that this smaller personal goal was achieved.
